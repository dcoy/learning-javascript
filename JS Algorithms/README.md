### JavaScript Algorithms

This is my implementation of algorithms in JavaScript.  I will work on these throughout my journey to become a software developer.

I intend to complete these algorithms and add more to this list as I learn.  Here's some that I have set out to learn:

- [ ] Anagrams
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Fizz Buzz
- [ ] Luhn Filter
- [ ] Print Primes
- [ ] Reverse Singly Linked list
- [ ] Shape Finding
- [ ] Sorting (Bubble, insertion, etc.)
