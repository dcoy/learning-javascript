### Learning JavaScript

Hello!  This is my repo that I am storing my progress as I learn more about JavaScript.  I will be using [O'Reilly's Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035534.do) as my main tool to learn JavaScript, the tools used in JS development and how to automate tasks with JS.  

I have also created a wiki that will outline my journey on becoming a JS developer and software developer overall.
